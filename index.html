    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="researchpaper">Black holes, once considered the unquenchable stomachs of the universe that not even light dares to escape, are now proven to be radiating bodies by the Hawking Radiation theory proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1974. Black holes were thought only to be able to absorb matter and energy. They have also been proven to radiate in the form of heat. Hawking Radiation reveals a mysterious quantum process at the event horizon that may unlock new theories to explain our universe. How will Hawking Radiation affect the thermodynamics of black holes and the information paradox? In this paper, we will delve through the depths of a black hole, gaining an understanding of the theory of Hawking Radiation, and its meaning to the world of physics. Hawking Radiation proposes a new quantum perspective on black holes and emphasizes the need for a consistent and unified theory of Everything. The paper will analyze theoretical concepts from quantum field theory, thermodynamics, and general relativity. </p>

    <h2>Black Holes</h2>
    <p class="researchpaper">Black holes are one of the most abstract yet simple-looking cosmic objects. These objects aren’t holes; they are spherical regions of huge mass concentrations compacted into tiny spheres. The high density in black holes produces such gravitational pull that at the Event Horizon, no light is fast enough to escape. Black holes are very mysterious, mostly due to their characteristic black color. We are not certain of the things inside the black hole; this phenomenon occurs due to light being unable to escape. When light approaches the black hole, it gets consumed by it, therefore unable to reflect its interior and escape the black hole. Since light can’t go inside and reach us, we just see a dark sphere. The border of this sphere is called the Event Horizon.</p>

    <h2>What is the Event Horizon?</h2>
    <p class="researchpaper">The point of no return is the exact point in space-time that not even the fastest objects in the whole universe can escape from. This such point is called Event Horizon. They have only been spotted in black holes. The Event Horizon is not a point but the black hole’s circumference. This is the line in which the gravitational pull is such that no light can escape, A.K.A. the point of no return. There may seem to be some sort of occurrence or effect when crossing the Event Horizon and adventuring into the black hole, but your entry won’t be clearly known. When you approach the black hole, for a bystander, your figure will start to slow down as you get close to the black hole. Your watch will start to tick slower in comparison to the bystander. As you get closer to the Event Horizon, your image will start to fade, and your image will be painted with some sort of ‘orangish’ color. Slowly the bystander will see your frozen image vanish, and one day there will be no longer any trace of you.</p>

    <h2>How are Black Holes made?</h2>
    <p class="researchpaper">The same way things die, other things are born. Even though stars have an incredible life expectancy, they also die. Starts are mainly composed of hydrogen and helium. This acts as fuel. These gases react with each other and create an outward push, fighting with gravity that caves in. As the star runs out of fuel, its push becomes weaker, and gravity starts winning. The gravity pushes the star’s matter inwards, therefore making it smaller. Eventually, the star’s core builds up iron, which cannot undergo fusion. As the star becomes reduced in size, its density increases as well as its gravitational pull. As gravity compresses the star, there is a point in which the star is so compressed, and the gravitational pull is so strong that a Supernova occurs. That is the death of the star and the birth of a black hole. Now that we know how stars die, how do black holes die?</p>

    <h2>How do Black Holes radiate?</h2>
    <p class="researchpaper">Black holes are spherical regions, often surrounded by matter. This matter radiates light; therefore, it can be detected from Earth. However, this radiation is indirect. It comes from the matter that orbits the black hole, not the black hole. The black hole is not an object but a region. Black holes are regions of space, not planets, they are places where anything that goes in is stored forever. Since it is a region, it should not radiate hence it has no surface. Near the Event Horizon space is empty, since space itself is what we call a “vacuum”. Which refers to a place where nothing exists. Although this is correct, according to quantum physics space is filled with fluctuations that are present everywhere, even in a “vacuum.” These fluctuations contain waves called virtual particles. Some with positive energy, and others with negative energy. In quantum physics, a “vacuum” is created when these fluctuations cancel each other, therefore, not influencing space. Although a “vacuum” only exists in certain frequencies. Virtual particles are waves and there are many types. They have different wavelengths, which leads to an infinite variety of them. If you had a radio and you scrolled through the different frequencies, you would hear noise, as you are scrolling through these frequencies, you would eventually hear silence. Once you hear silence, you know you found the frequency of two very important particles. The positive and the negative particles. These two peculiar virtual particles cancel each other, therefore, allowing silence. We will further talk about these particles on the next paragraph. In a “vacuum,” even if silent, the fluctuations are still there but nothing propagates in the field. These are virtual particles, but what about the real ones? Real particles are waves that are not canceled out. Waves that don’t have a pair to cancel each other out. Those are real particles.</p>
    <img class="Black-hole-graphimg" src="img/VirtualParticles.png" alt="Virtual particles">
    <p class="fig">Fig 3.2 Virtual Particles in a Black Hole</p>
    <p class="researchpaper">The "Vacuum” consists of a wave of positive energy and a wave of negative energy. The negative energy cannot exist by itself. It needs positive energy to cancel out. If positive energy was the gas that we use on cars, negative energy would be a sort of anti-gas that eliminates the gas proportionally. If there were 1l of gas and 0.5l of anti-gas, there would be 0.5l of gas remaining. Although the catch is that anti-gas cannot exist by itself. Its sole purpose is of mere annihilation. So, when two of these virtual particles appear near the black hole, thanks to the incredible curvature in space-time that the black hole creates, its massive pull prevents them from annihilating. This causes the negative particle to find a positive particle which is inside the black hole. So, it goes in and annihilates one of the black holes’ positive particles. Now the black hole has lost some of its energy. Therefore, making it smaller. Now the other positive particle that escaped the black hole. Turns into a real particle, because if we remember this particle was cancelling out with the other one, but since it doesn’t have any other particle to cancel out it becomes a real one. This is what happens if the negative particle falls in, but what if the black hole swallows the positively charged one?</p>
    <p class="researchpaper">If a negative particle that carries negative energy manages to escape while the positively charged one falls in, the negative particle would be forced to have negative energy relative to an outside observer. This would contradict many laws of physics since real observable particles cannot be negatively charged, they would be unphysical. That is why the positive one always escapes.</p>
    <p class="researchpaper">So, the car (the black hole) that has 1l of gas (the black hole’s energy) is slowly filled with anti-gas (negative particles) which causes the 1l of gas to vanish. The gas does not technically vanish, but it is transformed into heat. Hawking radiation is a form of heat radiation. Although on the spectrum, it is classified as one of the weakest. Although this can change.</p>
    <p class="researchpaper">Now that we understand how black holes radiate, we can delve deeper into understanding what exactly that radiation is. This radiation is heat, and black holes release heat. Black holes are extremely big because they always feed on the Cosmic Microwave Background, which consists of positively charged particles that roam space thanks to the Big Bang. In a few billion years, the universe will have expanded enough for these particles to scatter across it and become rare. Then, there will be more negative particles that fall inside than positive ones. Then, the black hole will start to lose energy, it will be slow at first, but as the black hole becomes smaller, it starts eating negative particles faster and faster. This happens because of three factors. As the black hole becomes smaller, space-time curvature becomes smaller and steeper, which increases the chance of virtual particles separating. As more negative particles fall in, more positive ones escape. This increases the temperature, which means more particle production. Finally, the runaway effect makes mass loss exponential, leading to rapid evaporation and the final black hole explosion. Yes, black holes do explode. There are so many positive particles escaping that its heat grows exponentially, leading to an explosion.</p>

  <div class="whatistheinformationparadox">
    <h2>What is the Information Paradox?</h2>
    <p class="researchpaper">Now that we understand how black holes explode, we can ask an even bigger question, what happens to everything that fell inside? This is the black hole information paradox. When something crosses the event horizon, it’s supposed to be lost forever. But if the black hole eventually evaporates and explodes, where does all that information go?</p>
    <p class="researchpaper">Here’s the problem. In physics, information can’t just disappear. Everything in the universe follows rules. If you have a book and burn it, the pages turn to ash, but the information in those pages still exists in the smoke, heat, and particles left behind. A black hole, however, doesn’t seem to work like that. It swallows everything, and when it finally dies, it just leaves behind Hawking radiation, no sign of what it once contained. That breaks the laws of quantum mechanics. Some theories say information gets scrambled in Hawking radiation, making it nearly impossible to recover. Others suggest black holes create a kind of “hologram” on the event horizon, keeping the information at the edge. The boldest idea? Maybe black holes don’t destroy information at all, maybe they spit it out into another universe.</p>
    <p class="researchpaper">The truth? We don’t fully know. But if black holes do break the rules of physics, then something about our understanding of reality is wrong. And that means there’s something even bigger waiting to be discovered.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="arethereparalleluniverses">
    <h2>Are there Parallel Universes?</h2>
    <p class="researchpaper">If black holes can mess with information, then maybe they can mess with reality itself. That’s where parallel universes come in. The idea is simple, what if our universe isn’t the only one? What if, every time something happens, reality splits, creating a new universe where things played out differently?</p>
    <p class="researchpaper">Black holes might be the key. When something falls inside, it’s gone from our universe, but does that mean it’s truly gone? Some theories suggest that instead of being crushed out of existence, matter and energy could be transported somewhere else—another universe, connected to ours through the black hole. If that’s true, black holes aren’t just destructive; they’re doorways. Some even think that every black hole could give birth to a new universe, each one slightly different from the other.</p>
    <p class="researchpaper">If parallel universes exist, there could be infinite versions of reality. A universe where Earth never formed, one where life evolved differently, maybe even one where you never read this. Right now, it’s all speculation, there is no proof that this happens, but if we ever prove it, it will mean our universe is just one thread in an endless cosmic web.</p>

  <div class="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="researchpaper">To wrap it all up, Hawking radiation changes many things in our understanding of black holes. It shows that black holes aren’t the mere voids of nothingness, as we once thought, they slowly lose mass and energy, radiating particles into space as they shrink. This process, predicted by Stephen Hawking, ties together quantum mechanics and general relativity in a way that might unlock answers to some of the universe’s deepest mysteries.</p>
    <p class="researchpaper">But Hawking radiation doesn’t just change our understanding of black holes; it pushes us to rethink everything about the fabric of reality. It’s not just about black holes disappearing, but about how information and energy behave when they reach the extremes of space-time. In the end, whether it’s the information paradox or the fate of the universe itself, Hawking radiation tells us that even the darkest corners of space have a story to tell, and we’re just beginning to listen.</p>

  <div class="researchstatus">
    <h2>Research Status</h2>
    <p class="researchpaper">In 1973, Bekenstein proposed black hole entropy, which Hawking’s work a year later complimented perfectly. Hawking’s discovery of black hole radiation using quantum field theory was truly impressive. Nowadays, there have been a few modifications to Hawking’s radiation theory involving solutions to the Trans-Planckian Problem or the Loop Quantum Gravity Problem. Although some changes and discoveries have been made, we still don’t know what happens with the information that the black hole swallows, the Information Paradox. This is one of the biggest mysteries in history, proposing solutions such as parallel universes or a portal to a new universe. These are mere speculations.</p>
