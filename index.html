    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="researchpaper">Black holes, once considered the unquenchable stomachs of the universe that not even light dares to escape, are now proven to be radiating bodies by the Hawking Radiation theory proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1974. Black holes were thought only to be able to absorb matter and energy. They have also been proven to radiate in the form of heat. Hawking Radiation reveals a mysterious quantum process at the event horizon that may unlock new theories to explain our universe. How will Hawking Radiation affect the thermodynamics of black holes and the information paradox? In this paper, we will delve through the depths of a black hole, gaining an understanding of the theory of Hawking Radiation, and its meaning to the world of physics. Hawking Radiation proposes a new quantum perspective on black holes and emphasizes the need for a consistent and unified theory of Everything. The paper will analyze theoretical concepts from quantum field theory, thermodynamics, and general relativity. </p>

    <h2>Black Holes</h2>
    <p class="researchpaper">Black holes are one of the most abstract yet simple-looking cosmic objects. These objects aren’t holes; they are spherical regions of huge mass concentrations compacted into tiny spheres. The high density in black holes produces such gravitational pull that at the Event Horizon, no light is fast enough to run away. Black holes are very mysterious, mostly due to their characteristic black color. We are not certain of the things inside the black hole; this phenomenon occurs due to light being unable to escape. When light approaches the black hole, it gets consumed by it, therefore unable to reflect its interior and escape the black hole. Since light can’t go inside and reach us, we just see a dark sphere. The border of this sphere is called the Event Horizon.</p>
