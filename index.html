    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="researchpaper">Black holes, once considered the unquenchable stomachs of the universe that not even light dares to escape, are now proven to be radiating bodies by the Hawking Radiation theory proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1974. Black holes were thought only to be able to absorb matter and energy. They have also been proven to radiate in the form of heat. Hawking Radiation reveals a mysterious quantum process at the event horizon that may unlock new theories to explain our universe. How will Hawking Radiation affect the thermodynamics of black holes and the information paradox? In this paper, we will delve through the depths of a black hole, gaining an understanding of the theory of Hawking Radiation, and its meaning to the world of physics. Hawking Radiation proposes a new quantum perspective on black holes and emphasizes the need for a consistent and unified theory of Everything. The paper will analyze theoretical concepts from quantum field theory, thermodynamics, and general relativity. </p>
